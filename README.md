Smart Solar Grid Management System
Project Overview
The Smart Solar Grid Management System is an advanced web-based platform designed to monitor, analyze, and optimize solar power generation for residential and agricultural use. This system goes beyond simple monitoring by integrating AI-powered predictions and real-time grid management capabilities. The goal is to provide a clean, user-friendly interface that empowers users to maximize energy efficiency and minimize costs.

Key Features
Overall Dashboard: A summary view that provides a high-level overview of the entire solar system. It includes widgets for total panels, real-time power generation, system efficiency, and a summary of active alerts.
Panel-Wise Monitoring: A detailed view that allows users to drill down into the performance of individual solar panels. It displays real-time data for Voltage, Current, Temperature, Irradiance, and Instant Power, with graphs that update continuously.
Real-time Alerts: The system generates intelligent alerts for potential issues like underperforming, dusty, or overheated panels, allowing for proactive maintenance.
AI-Powered Prediction: Using historical and real-time data, the system provides a 24-hour forecast of solar power generation, helping users plan their energy usage and manage expectations.

Grid Management: The dashboard visualizes the real-time balance between solar power supply and grid demand. It provides insights into when power is available for the grid and warns of potential shortages.
Interactive Graphs: All key metrics are visualized using interactive line, bar, and area charts for a clear understanding of daily, weekly, and monthly trends.
Data Export: Users can easily export real-time and historical data in CSV format for offline analysis and reporting.
Responsive UI: The dashboard is built to be fully responsive, providing an optimal viewing experience on both mobile and desktop devices.
Dark Mode: A toggle for switching to a low-light, dark theme for enhanced usability.

Tech Stack
This project is a single-file React prototype that simulates the functionality of a full-stack IoT system.

Frontend
React.js: The core JavaScript library for building the user interface.
Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework used for all styling.
Recharts: A charting library for creating all the data visualization graphs.

Backend (Simulated)
In a production environment, the following technologies would be used to build a robust backend. The current application simulates their behavior.
Python / Node.js: Backend languages for handling business logic.
FastAPI / Express: Backend frameworks for creating a RESTful API.
MongoDB / Firebase: Databases for persistent data storage.
WebSockets / Socket.IO: For real-time data streaming.
LSTM / Prophet: Machine learning models for power prediction.

APIs & Data
OpenWeatherMap API: Used to get real-time weather data.
Simulated IoT Data: Custom JavaScript scripts that generate realistic sensor data for each panel.

How to Run
This project is a single, self-contained file. To run it, you can simply open the smart-solar-dashboard.jsx file in a development environment that supports React and Tailwind, such as a local setup with Node.js and a package manager.
Make sure you have Node.js installed.
Install the necessary dependencies. In a typical React project setup, this would be done with npm install or yarn install.
Start the development server with npm start or yarn start.
The application will then be available in your browser, running all the simulated features.
